To whom it may concern,

My name is Angelo De Laurentis I’m a Student at Cal Poly, and I am very interested in your internship this summer
I saw your posting on mustang jobs, and was then introduced in person at the career fair! I think both my skills and interests would be a good match for you
r posting.
I originally came to Cal Poly in the Electrical Engineering program, but after taking the limited computer science classes that are included in the Electrical Engineering curriculum, I realized that I had a passion for data structures and algorithm development. So, I decided I wanted more computer science in my education, which prompted me to change over to Computer Engineering. I’m currently a  sophomore in the  Computer Engineering program at Cal Poly, but I hold senior standing because of the Running Start program I took back high school. This program allowed me to graduate with an Associate's of Science, fulfilling most of Cal Poly’s GE requirements for underclassmen. Thanks to that, I had plenty of room in my schedule to take the extra coding classes that allowed me to switch majors.
Last summer I worked for a company in Seattle, Washington called Casne Engineering, mainly in their IT department. I worked heavily in Cisco PI, managing their switches around the office, and even developed heat maps for Seatac International Airport. I also configured VM’s for graceful shutdown on top of forklift, making sure our battery outages wouldn’t be catastrophic. I had a good introduction to cloud computing working for Casne, especially when I was tasked with creating profiles highlighting the pros and cons of taking our data to the cloud using either AWS or MS Azure. 
I now have 2-3 years of python experience under my belt, plus a few quarters of Java experience, and I will have learned C and Unix by the end of spring quarter. I have been educated in advanced data structures, algorithm analysis, object oriented programming, memory and speed efficiency, and some more lower-level circuitry knowledge, like assembly language, VHDL, and even circuitry analysis. 

Sincerely,

Angelo De Laurentis
