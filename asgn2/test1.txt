test test test let's get it on boy

I got this if you want this I can get it


Girl you should know that I can love you better than he can.

I just text my main chick tell her I ain't commin home tonight


pop bottles by the way

you could hit me with the bombay

I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid (yeah)
To take a stand, it's been a ride
Everybody, I guess I had to
Go to that place
To get to this one
Now some of you
Might still be in that place
If you're tryin' to get out
Just follow me
I'll get you there
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
